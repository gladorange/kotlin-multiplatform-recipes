# Recipes for Multi-Platform Kotlin Modules

This project is a testbed for multi-platform Kotlin modules. It shows how you could implement modules that have code that is common for all platforms, and that may need platform-specific code for (some of) its types and functions.

Note that you have to change settings in IntelliJ IDEA to be able to build the project and run the examples from your IDE. See the item about IntelliJ IDEA under *current issues* below.

Recipes for unit tests for common and platform-specific code are available. Execute the following command to run the Java tests. The test output can be found in `jvm/build/reports/tests/test/index.html`:

    ./gradlew :jvm:test
    
Execute the following command to run the JavaScript tests. The test output can be found in the build output:

    ./gradlew :js:test

## Current Issues

Not everything is working as it should as multi-platform support is still being developed. This is the list of known issues:

* IntelliJ IDEA support using stable plug-ins is broken. The experience should be better with an [EAP](https://discuss.kotlinlang.org/c/eap) or [development](https://github.com/jetbrains/kotlin#-installing-the-latest-kotlin-plugin) build, and using the associated Gradle plug-in and standard library from the [Kotlin development repository](https://bintray.com/kotlin/kotlin-dev/kotlin):
    * You have to build and run the examples using the Gradle runner by enabling the following setting: Settings › Build, Execution, Deployment › Build Tools › Gradle › Runner › Delegate IDE build/run actions to gradle), or use the command line. To run the Java app:
  
            ./gradlew :jvm-app:run

        Or to run the JavaScript app:
  
            ./gradlew :js-app:runDceKotlinJs

        And open `js-app/JsApp.html`. The JavaScript has been mapped to the sources of the Kotlin standard library and module `js`, so you can set breakpoints in Kotlin code. Note that for some reason, the source maps are not available if you open the browser from within IntelliJ. Copy the file path of `jsApp.html` and paste that in the address bar of your browser. 
        
        If you want to use the minified JavaScript run:
  
            ./gradlew :js-app:minifyJs

        And open `js-app/JsApp-minified.html`.
